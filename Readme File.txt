Video_Distortion_Detection_Classification Zip Folder Contains total 6 folder:

-> Libraries Information
-> Matlab Combined Code
-> Project Testing CSV Files
-> Saved Models
-> Source Code
-> Web App


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Libraries Information  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Libraries Information Contain 2 Files:
1. Libraries
2. VDDC

=> Libraries file contain all those libraries name and their Versions that been used during the Project.
=> VDDC(YML File) Contains information about all those libraries that been installed in the conda Environment.


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Matlab Combined Code  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Matlab Combined Code Folder Contain 2 Folder:
1. Combined_Matlab_Code_Mix_Distortion
2. Combined_Matlab_Code_Single_Distortion

=> Combined_Matlab_Code_Mix_Distortion further contain one .m file named "Matlab_Combined_Module.m" and 4 folder:
--- CSV File
--- Frames
--- OG-IQA
--- Videos

When Your open Matlab_Combined_Module.m file in MATLAB Software, You need need to give the address of your testing video. After that it will extract it's frames
in the form of images and than process those images to extract their features for each frame and than generate you a CSV file that contain total 6 features for 
each frame.   
-- CSV File Folder Contain those CSV features files generated by Matlab_Combined_Module.m
-- Frames Folder Contain all the frames in the form of images generated by Matlab_Combined_Module.m
-- OG-IQA Folder contain the modules prototype that extract features from the given frame.
-- Videos Folder contain a sample video that you can load in Matlab_Combined_Module.m to generate a CSV File.

 

=> Combined_Matlab_Code_Single_Distortion further contain one .m file named "Matlab_Combined_Module.m" and 4 folder:
--- CSV File
--- Frames
--- OG-IQA
--- SSEQ
--- Videos

When Your open Matlab_Combined_Module.m file in MATLAB Software, You need need to give the address of your testing video. After that it will extract it's frames
in the form of images and than process those images to extract their features for each frame and than generate you a CSV file that contain total 18 features for 
each frame.   
-- CSV File Folder Contain those CSV features files generated by Matlab_Combined_Module.m
-- Frames Folder Contain all the frames in the form of images generated by Matlab_Combined_Module.m
-- OG-IQA Folder contain the module prototype that extract 6 features from the given frame.
-- SSEQ Folder contain the module prototype that extract 12 features from the given frame.
-- Videos Folder contain a sample video that you can load in Matlab_Combined_Module.m to generate a CSV File.


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Project Testing CSV Files  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Project Testing CSV Files Folder Contain 2 Folder:
1. Category 1
2. Category 2

=> Category 1 contain further 3 Folders
-- Stage_1_Testing_Files
-- Stage_2_Testing_Files
-- Stage_3_Testing_Files

Stage_1_Testing_Files contain only those csv files that you can load in main file to test whether the distortion is present in the video or not for the Single Distortion
Detection and Classification
Stage_2_Testing_Files contain only those csv files that you can load in main file to test which type of distortion is present in the video for Single Distortion
Detection and Classification
Stage_3_Testing_Files contain only those csv files that you can load in main file to test which intensity level of those distortion present in the video for Single Distortion
Detection and Classification


=> Category 2 contain further 3 Folders
-- Stage_1_Testing_Files
-- Stage_2_Testing_Files
-- Stage_3_Testing_Files


Stage_1_Testing_Files contain only those csv files that you can load in main source file to test whether the distortions is present in the video or not for the MIX Distortion
Detection and Classification
Stage_2_Testing_Files contain only those csv files that you can load in main source file to test which type of distortions is present in the video for MIX Distortion
Detection and Classification
Stage_3_Testing_Files contain only those csv files that you can load in main source file to test which intensity level of those distortions present in the video for MIX Distortion
Detection and Classification


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Saved Models  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Saved Models Folder contain all the saved models files that were saved after the training of models on csv files for the three stages for both Mix and Single Distortions 


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Source Code  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Source Code Folder contain 17 total files in which Source Code.py is the main file that you can run on python compiler software and load you your csv file for which 
you need to check nature of your video. All the other 16 remaining files are our saved Models files that were used in Source Code.py file.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Web App  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Web App folder contain the files for the web app that we created for testing the csv files. After defining the folder path in your Anaconda Prompt. you have to run the following 
command to get the Web App in your conda prompt "streamlit run ProjectApp.py". After that your can load the features csv files in that web app and get the results for
the nature of your video.
